>
> Dear Flipp Team,
> 
> My name is Attila Gulyas, manager of the Access News audio reading service at Society For The Blind, a non-profit organization in Sacramento, CA.
> 
> https://societyfortheblind.org/programs-services/access-news/
 >
 > The most popular content among our blind, low vision, and print-impaired subscribers are the store ads, and I'm wondering if there is a public API to your service or another way to access the textual information in the flyers?
 >  
 > The reason I'm asking is because the specials are read by volunteers every week, which means that the audio version is only available to listeners with a 2â€“4-day delay, depending on volunteer availability. Having the data would allow us to use text-to-speech technology to publish these almost immediately after publication.
 >
 > Have a great rest of your day and wishing you a wonderful weekend!
