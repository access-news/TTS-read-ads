As far as I can tell, every single store (large or small, nationwide or local to a state, grocery or retail, etc.) puts out the same flyers everywhere, regardless of geographic location. Which is weird, given that most of the sites won't show the ads until a ZIP code is given and/or a store is chosen. (I presume this done to collect user statistics?)

## Chains using [flipp](https://corp.flipp.com/)

Couldn't find an public API description, but one can find the URLs of the API via Chrome's dev tools on the "Network" tab (TODO: insert methods from other browswers here).

See [Safeway's README](./safeway/README.md) for more.
